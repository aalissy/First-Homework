# Code Refactor Starter Code
## Description
For this project, I was tasked with updating both the html and css code of a website that follows accessibility standards. This makes it optimized for google searches and keeps the code consolidated and organized.

## User Story
AS A marketing agency

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
